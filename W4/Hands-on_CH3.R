# Hands-on Week - Working with **gapminder** Data
# Please be advised that this file should be run without any modification on any RStudio software. Therefore, it is essential to include all necessary libraries and prerequisit syntaxes. 

# a) What happens when you put the *geom_smooth()* function before *geom_point()* instead of after it in *Healy_CH3.R*? What does this tell you about how the plot is drawn? Think about how this might be useful when drawing plots.

# b) Change the mappings in the *aes()* function so that you plot **life expectancy** against **population (pop)** rather than per capita GDP. Also, refine all functions/labels accordingly. What does that look like? What does it tell you about the unit of observation in the dataset?
